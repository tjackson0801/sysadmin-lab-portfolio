# Week 1: Initial NGINX Web Server Setup

**Goal:** 
Install and configure a basic web server on AlmaLinux using NGINX. Validate web service status and accessibility from a browser.

**What I Did:**
- Installed NGINX with `dnf install -y nginx`
- Enabled and started the NGINX service using `systemctl`
- Created a custom HTML file at `/var/www/html/tylersite/index.html`
- Verified the web server was running via `systemctl status`
- Viewed the served webpage through a browser using the VM IP

**Screenshots:**
- NGINX status confirmation
- Custom HTML file content
- Browser rendering the web page
-  Firewall config showing port 80 open

**Skills Practiced:**
- Package installation with `dnf`
- Service management (`systemctl`)
- Basic web hosting with NGINX
- File editing and directory navigation
