📦 Week 3: Bash & Ansible Automation







🛠️ Skills Practiced:





Bash scripting for service automation
Systemd service control (systemctl)
Ansible playbook creation and execution
Inventory file configuration with password-based SSH
HTML deployment via script and automation






🔄 What I Did:





This week, I automated the deployment of a basic NGINX web server using two approaches:



Bash Script:
I created and executed a custom nginx_setup.sh script that:
Installed the NGINX package
Created a custom directory at /var/www/html/tylersite
Deployed a simple index.html page with the message “Deployed by Bash Script”
Ansible Playbook:
I built an Ansible playbook.yml to perform the same task using infrastructure-as-code:
Installed NGINX
Enabled and started the service
Created the custom site directory
Pushed a new HTML file with “Deployed by Ansible Playbook”




Each deployment was verified by visiting the hosted page on my VM’s IP via browser.
