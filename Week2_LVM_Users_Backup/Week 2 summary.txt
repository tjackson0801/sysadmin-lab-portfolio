# Week 2: LVM Setup, User Management, and Backup (RHCSA Lab)

**Goal:** 
Build foundational system administration skills by configuring LVM storage, managing user permissions, and performing backups.

**What I Did:**
- Added a second virtual disk and partitioned it using `fdisk`
- Created a physical volume, volume group (`vg_data`), and logical volume (`lv_data`) using LVM tools
- Formatted the logical volume with XFS and mounted it to `/mnt/data`
- Created users `alice` and `bob`, and a group called `devops`
- Added both users to the `devops` group
- Set directory permissions using `chown` and `chmod` to give group access to `/mnt/data`
- Verified user access by switching to `alice` and creating a file inside `/mnt/data`
- Created a compressed backup of the `/etc` directory using `tar`
- Verified that the backup archive was successfully created and stored in the home directory

**Screenshots:**
- LVM creation (`pvcreate`, `vgcreate`, `lvcreate`)
- Disk partitioning with `fdisk`
- Mounted volume shown in `df -h`
- User and group creation
- Group permissions test (`touch test.txt` and `ls -l`)
- Backup file existence (`etc-backup.tar.gz`)

**Skills Practiced:**
- LVM provisioning and volume management
- User and group administration
- Directory permission control
- Backup and file archiving with `tar`
- Verification of access and system configuration
